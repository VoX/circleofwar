## introduction
Circle of War is a 2D top-down battle royale game inspired by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
Players compete to be the last surviving individual or team, utilizing a number of weapons, tools, and abilities to defeat other players
Unlike many of its cousins in the BR genre, Circle of War is less dependent on sneaking and spotting mechanics, and instead relies on fast-paced action combat.

## background
In the darkness of the future, people are forced to kill one another inside of a circle. Because battle royale.

## design
Circle of War will employ a simplistic top-down art style, point-to-shoot mechanics and WASD movement. Players will seek to outgun, outmaneuver, or simply outplay their opponents as they stay within the deadly Circle on a variety of maps.
### storyboard
Players will have the opportunity to choose one of a number of classes before each match, conferring slight bonuses to their character.
As a round begins, players will randomly be placed around the world(?), and will need to find weapons and equipment to survive.
Throughout the game, the Circle will constantly shrink, forcing players into smaller and smaller areas of conflict.
Rounds will last approximately 10-15 minutes, and players will be awarded points for their successes in each round.
Dead players will have the opportunity to wager their points on surviving players.
### potentials
In order to enhance the top-down gameplay style, we are considering a variety of gameplay features, including:
* line of sight mechanics
* class and class abilities
* destructible terrain and explosive world objects
